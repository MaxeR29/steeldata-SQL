For creating SQL Queries I used db-fiddle.com and engine of the SQLite v3.39;
I can create SQL Queries in Oracle SQL and MS SQL, as well.

Notes: 
Task 6: Added extra information, because on first look for me it was hard task, 
but after analyzing it becomes much easier and I have decided to add extra information :)

Task 10: It was a bit hard and interesting task. Think did it good. If you will have some suggestions
I'm open for it :)
